# Reinforcement learning tutorial 3A - BAMB 2023
This tutorial is adapted from the code associated with the following paper:
"Ten Simple Rules for Computational Modeling of Psychological Data" Collins and Wilson (2019) eLife.

Two main python notebooks are provided, one with the instructions and one with the solutions, together with RL_library.py, which contains a number of pre-coded functions useful for the tutorial.
